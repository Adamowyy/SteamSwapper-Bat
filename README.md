### SteamSwapper-Bat - a safe way to swap accounts faster!

A simple script that allows you to quickly switch between an **infinite number** of Steam accounts.

There's no need to install or configure any third-party applications!

## Instructions:

1. **Replace** filename "YourUsername".bat with your second account username!
2. **Run** the script.
3. **Enjoy!** Your Steam will be switched to your "filename" account.
4. Copy the file YourUsername.bat, change its name to your main account username, for example, and you're done!

- Additionally, if you wish to run a game, you can remove **"rem"** from **start "gamepath/game.exe"** and add your game path, e.g. if you have an account with one game.
- Ugly .bat ICON or "username" on your desktop? No problem! Just hide YourUsername.bat somewhere, create a shortcut and you can change the name and icon as you like!

#### Security Assurance:

Your Steam credentials remain confidential as the script only changes the AutoLogin username, ensuring your account security remains intact.

SteamSwapper makes switching between Steam accounts easy and convenient. Just put your username in filename, run the script and let Steam do the rest.

#### Note:
I created this script for myself because the solutions I found online didn't satisfy me. I am a person who pays attention to the smallest details, so I wanted to make sure that the script worked perfectly. So, I decided to share it with others who may find it useful.
