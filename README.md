### SteamSwapper.bat - a safe way to swap accounts faster!

A simple script that allows you to quickly swap between **TWO** Steam accounts.

You don't need to install any third party apps!

## Instructions:

1. **Edit** SteamSwapper.bat with **notepad**.
2. Replace **"PutYourUsernameHere"** with your Steam **username**.
3. **Run** the script.
4. **Enjoy!** Steam will be switched between the accounts you are logged into.

- Additionally, if you wish to run a game, you can remove **"rem"** from **"start GamePath/game.exe"** and add your game path, e.g. if you have an account with one game.

#### Security Assurance:

Your Steam credentials remain confidential as the script only changes the AutoLogin username, ensuring your account security remains intact.

SteamSwapper.bat makes switching between Steam accounts easy and convenient. Just put your usernames, run the script and let Steam do the rest.

#### Note:
I created this script for myself because the solutions I found online didn't satisfy me. I am a person who pays attention to the smallest details, so I wanted to make sure that the script worked perfectly. So, I decided to share it with others who may find it useful.
